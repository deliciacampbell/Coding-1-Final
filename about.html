<h1>About Page</h1>
  <p class="about">My name is Delicia Campbell and I am very passionate about music. Music has always been something that has helped me 
    concentrate, calm down and even just make me happy. I always have music playing whether I'm getting homework done,
    studying and even sometimes when I go to sleep. Music has helped me to feel better about certain situations I have been 
    in and also has changed me as a person. I listen to all kinds of music however my favorite genre is r&b, lyrical rap, 
    sometimes pop. In the future I hope to be able to attend as many concerts as I can since it is always something I had 
    a strong interest for. I would love to see Sza, Giveon, ZAYN, Beyonce, and so many others. Their music has helped me
    and even inspired me to achieve my goals.

    Back during my freshmen year of high school, I decided  I wanted to learn how to play piano. A big inspiration of mines was 
    ALicia Keys. I admired how she played and wanted to learn for myself, so I took some classes and learned how to read music and
    play some of my favorite songs. I no longer take classes, however I still enjoy playing piano in my freetime.
